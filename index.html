            <p>Hi, I am Mohit Vinaakar – a passionate web and app developer from India. I specialize in building user-friendly and efficient websites and applications using modern technologies. I have worked on a variety of projects, including form validation systems, event registration platforms, real estate websites, and more.</p>
            <p>I'm not just a frontend or backend developer – I like working on both ends and enjoy full-stack development. I have got hands-on experience using Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and more.</p>
            <p>I love learning, solving real-world problems, and building things that make life easier. Right now, I am focusing on sharpening my Java skills for placement and also diving deep into robotics and AI.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for someone who's curious, hard-working, and always ready to learn new things – that's me.

            <p>These are the skills I currently have, and I am continuously working on them to improve and master each one. I believe in consistent learning and hands-on practice, which is why I spend time building real-world projects, exploring new technologies, and refining my problem-solving abilities.
            My goal is not just to know how these tools work, but to understand them deeply and use them effectively to build impactful, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I enjoy the challenge of debugging, optimizing performance, and bringing creative ideas to life through code.</p>
